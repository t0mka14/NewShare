# Remote Configuration — JSON Specification

**Status:** Normative · **Date:** 2026-07-01 (rev. 2026-08-22) · **Target:** SHARE clinical
recording app (rewrite)

Companion to [Project_Specification.md](Project_Specification.md) (§6). This document defines
the configuration JSON pushed from the server to the app.

## 1. Purpose and fetch flow

On startup (and on manual refresh in Settings) the app sends a **GET request containing its
site token** and receives a single configuration JSON.

- Endpoint: `GET /site-config/{siteToken}` on the web backend. The token is the site's
  `access_token`, shared by every computer of the site.
- **Validation happens during this request:** the server validates the token and either
  returns the configuration or an error response (404 unknown token, 403 site deactivated,
  429 too many failed lookups). There is no separate registration step.
- On success the app validates `schemaVersion`, caches the JSON to `data/config/config.json`,
  and activates it.
- If the server is unreachable, the last cached config is used. With no cache (first run
  offline) the app shows a blocking "configuration required" screen.
- Every recorded session stores a snapshot of the active config
  (`task_configuration_snapshot.json`).

The configuration fully describes:

- one or more **protocols** (ordered lists of configured tasks),
- each **task** (one screen in the protocol),
- the **application config** (participant input fields, editor on/off, locale, …),
- all **localized strings**.

## 2. Top-level structure

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "configVersion": "2026-07-01.1",
  "defaultLanguage": "cs",
  "languages": ["cs", "en"],
  "defaultMicName": "USBAudioDevice",
  "defaultMicGain": 63,
  "enableEditor": false,
  "indicatorType": "CIRCLE",
  "useCalibration": true,
  "protocols": [ /* Protocol objects, §3 */ ],
  "strings": { /* localization, §6 */ }
}
```

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | int | Parser compatibility; app rejects unknown major versions |
| `configVersion` | string | Server-side revision identifier, stored in session snapshots |
| `defaultLanguage` | string | Fallback language |
| `languages` | string[] | Languages selectable in the UI |
| `defaultMicName` | string | The microphone **model** the session records from when Settings has no saved device (a device saved in Settings wins), and the target of `defaultMicGain`. Give the device's product string as the sound panel shows it, e.g. `USB audio CODEC` — the same physical device is named `Microphone (USB audio CODEC)` on Windows, `USB audio CODEC` on macOS and `CODEC [plughw:3,0]` on Linux, so the value is matched case-insensitively as a substring of the device's name + description, which all three contain. It identifies a model, not a unit. Java on Windows cuts device names to 31 characters (JDK-7116070); a name cut through the model string still matches while at least half of it (and six characters) remain |
| `defaultMicGain` | int | 0..100 input level (the Windows sound panel's units) set on the device matching `defaultMicName` right before it is opened for a session. Validated (a value outside 0..100 rejects the config). A level set on the Settings slider wins over this value. Omit to leave the OS level alone (§13 decision 44 of the project specification) |
| `enableEditor` | boolean | Show waveform boundary editor after the protocol |
| `indicatorType` | enum | `CIRCLE` (pulsating circle following RMS level) \| `WAVEFORM` (rolling ~3 s amplitude envelope) — live feedback on VOCAL task screens |
| `useCalibration` | boolean | Show the calibration screen before the first task of every protocol that contains a `VOCAL` task (§4.3). Absent = `false` |

All flags are real JSON booleans (`true`/`false`), never `0`/`1`.

## 3. Protocol

A protocol is a named, ordered list of configured tasks. Task numbering ("task 3 of 10") is
**derived from list position** and is not stored in the JSON.

```json
{
  "name": "Share",
  "project": "PD study",
  "protocolInstructionsPdfUrl": "https://example.org/share/protocol_manuals/MDSE_app_manual_2024.pdf",
  "recordingsFileName": "${field.patient_code}_${installationId}_${taskIndex}_${task.subtype}_Rep${repetition}",
  "patientFields": [ /* PatientField objects, §5 */ ],
  "tasks": [ /* Task objects, §4 */ ]
}
```

- `project` — optional name of the web project the protocol belongs to. The protocol picker
  groups protocols under a heading per project. A protocol linked to several of the site's
  projects is listed once per project (same `name`, different `project`), so a protocol is
  identified by `name` + `project`; sessions record both (`examination.json`
  `protocolName`/`protocolProject`).
- `protocolInstructionsPdfUrl` — optional URL of the protocol's instruction manual
  (PDF). When at least one protocol defines it the main menu's "Get protocol PDF"
  button is enabled and opens the URL with the system browser; when several protocols
  define one, the button first offers a picker of protocol names. Omitted or blank
  disables the button. It is a URL, never a filesystem path — the app resolves nothing
  locally (machine independence).
  **Renamed 2026-08-22** from `manualFilePath`, which held an install-relative path
  (`protocol_manuals/…pdf`) that nothing ever resolved. Unknown keys are ignored, so a config
  still sending `manualFilePath` decodes without error but leaves the button disabled — servers
  must emit the new key (and a real URL) for the button to appear.
- `recordingsFileName` — clip filename template, the authoritative source of clip names.
  Supported variables: `${installationId}`, `${taskIndex}` (0-based position in the expanded
  task list; the first task is 0, calibration is not a task), `${task.subtype}`,
  `${repetition}`, and `${field.<name>}` — the value entered for this protocol's patient field
  `<name>`, sanitized to `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` (empty when not filled in). The template **must include
  `${taskIndex}`** so that two tasks with the same subtype cannot produce colliding filenames,
  and every `${field.<name>}` must name one of the protocol's `patientFields`; config
  validation rejects templates that break either rule. (`${patientCode}` no longer exists.)
- `patientFields` — the participant fields shown after this protocol is picked (§5).
- Recordings are always stored under the app data directory
  (`data/sessions/<session>/…`); the config never contains filesystem paths for output
  (machine independence).
- Calibration is not a task: with `useCalibration` the app shows its calibration screen before
  the first task of a protocol that contains a `VOCAL` task (§4.3). Protocols with no `VOCAL`
  tasks (questionnaire/info-only) never calibrate and produce no master recording.

## 4. Task

Tasks are polymorphic on the `type` discriminator:

`VOCAL` · `QUESTIONNAIRE` · `INFO` · `VIDEO`

- `VOCAL` — audio recording tasks (phonation, DDK/PATAKA, reading, monologue, …), refined by
  `subtype`.
- `QUESTIONNAIRE` — form screens (spelling normalized; the parser accepts the legacy alias
  `QUESTIONAIRE` with a logged warning during server migration).
- `INFO` — display-only screen (e.g., final screen).
- `VIDEO` — camera recording (e.g. emotions). Shares VOCAL's Start/Stop/Repeat flow; one file
  per take.

Fields common to all task types:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `type` | enum | Discriminator, see above |
| `titleKey` | string | Localization key |
| `canRepeat` | boolean | Repeat/Again button available |
| `canSkip` | boolean | Skip button available |
| `nrepetition` | int | Number of repetitions; the task expands into this many **separate task instances** ("Rep 1" … "Rep N") in the protocol flow |

Repetition semantics: with `canRepeat`, each task instance can be re-tried any number of
times (each Repeat press rejects the current take and starts a new one). **Only the last
take of each instance is cut out during processing**; earlier takes remain in the master
recording and timeline as an audit trail. E.g. two repetitions tried three times each yield
two exported clips.

### 4.1 VOCAL

```json
{
  "type": "VOCAL",
  "subtype": "PHONATION",
  "titleKey": "phonation_title",
  "instructionKeys": ["phonation_instructions1", "phonation_instructions2"],
  "length": 10,
  "showIndicator": true,
  "canRepeat": true,
  "canSkip": false,
  "audioExamplePath": "https://example.org/share/audio/aaa.wav",
  "nrepetition": 1
}
```

- `subtype`: `PHONATION` | `PATAKA` | `SYLLABLES` | `READING` | `MONOLOGUE` | `RETELLING` |
  `COUNTING` | `CUSTOM`. The subtype is a label (it feeds `${task.subtype}` and
  `examination.json`); every subtype uses the same Start/Stop/Repeat screen. `CUSTOM` is the
  generic one the web emits for any voice task without a dedicated subtype.
- `length` — target duration in seconds.
- `instructionKeys` — one key per instruction paragraph (replaces the draft's `nTextFields`;
  the count is the array length). The first paragraph is always shown; the rest are shown on
  the first repetition only. **`READING`:** the *last* paragraph is the passage to read aloud,
  shown in its own scrollable panel on every repetition (with a single paragraph, that
  paragraph is the passage).
- `audioExamplePath` — optional example audio, played on demand, never recorded. An absolute
  `http(s)` URL: the app downloads it when a new config is applied and caches it locally, so it
  also plays offline afterwards. No key, a non-http value, or a download that failed means no
  example button. A changed file needs a new URL (the cache is keyed by URL).

### 4.2 QUESTIONNAIRE

```json
{
  "type": "QUESTIONNAIRE",
  "titleKey": "questionnaire_title",
  "questions": [ /* Question objects, §4.2.1 */ ],
  "canRepeat": true,
  "canSkip": false,
  "nrepetition": 1
}
```

Answers are stored inside the session's **`examination.json`** and uploaded with it (no
separate answers file or endpoint). A questionnaire has no timer: a `length` key is ignored, as
is `canRepeat` (nothing is recorded, so there is nothing to repeat).

#### 4.2.1 Question

```json
{
  "questionType": "OPEN",
  "questionKey": "question_key",
  "questionTextKey": "question_text_key",
  "questionRegex": ".*",
  "questionOptions": ["optionA_key", "optionB_key"]
}
```

- `questionType`: `OPEN` | `SINGLE_CHOICE` | `MULTIPLE_CHOICE`.
- `questionRegex` — validation for `OPEN` answers only. An unanswered question counts as the
  empty string, so `.*` makes it optional and `.+` required; no regex means free, optional text.
  `SINGLE_CHOICE` needs exactly one option, `MULTIPLE_CHOICE` accepts none.
- `questionOptions` — localization keys, required for choice types, absent for `OPEN`.

### 4.3 Calibration (not a task)

There is no `CALIBRATION` task type (removed 2026-09-27, config alignment row 5; a config that
contains one fails to decode). When the top-level `useCalibration` is `true` and the protocol
contains at least one `VOCAL` task, the app shows its calibration screen before the first task:
the examiner confirms the observed level lies within the target band, and only then does the
master recording begin. With `useCalibration: false` the recording starts right away.

The target band `[min, max]` is **not** part of the config: it is the local app setting
`optimalLoudness` in `settings.json`, default `[0.2, 0.5]`. Units: linear RMS normalized to
full scale (0.0–1.0), smoothed over a ~300 ms window. The screen's text uses the built-in keys
`calibration.title` and `calibration.instructions`, which a config's `strings` may override.

### 4.4 INFO

```json
{
  "type": "INFO",
  "titleKey": "info_title",
  "instructionKeys": ["info_instructions1", "info_instructions2"]
}
```

### 4.5 VIDEO

```json
{
  "type": "VIDEO",
  "subtype": "EMOTIONS",
  "titleKey": "emotions_title",
  "instructionKeys": ["emotions_instructions"],
  "length": 30,
  "canRepeat": true,
  "canSkip": false,
  "nrepetition": 1,
  "havePTZ": false
}
```

`length` is the target take duration in seconds, shown on the task timer exactly as for VOCAL;
it does not stop the recording, which ends when the examiner presses Stop.

`havePTZ` requests pan/tilt/zoom controls. They render only where the host also has a PTZ
backend — currently Windows alone, since the implementation is DirectShow over COM. On any
other platform the flag is accepted and the controls are simply absent, so the same
configuration is safe to deploy everywhere.

Any UVC camera is supported, not only PTZ models. The app asks the camera which modes it
offers and uses the best one available (preferring a mode it can record without re-encoding,
then the one closest to 1080p), falling back to fixed resolutions and finally the device
default if the camera reports nothing usable. A plain webcam records normally — it just shows
no PTZ controls.

Recordings are written to `video/task<NN>_rep<NN>_take<NN>.mjpeg` inside the session directory
and are included in the upload ZIP.

## 5. PatientField

Participant-input configuration comes from the server, per protocol (`Protocol.patientFields`,
§3), and replaces the local patient configuration screens of the original app. The form is
shown after the protocol is picked.

```json
{
  "name": "visit_number",
  "labelKey": "p70_f_visit_number_label",
  "helpKey": "p70_f_visit_number_help",
  "placeholder": "V0",
  "regex": "V\\d+",
  "required": true
}
```

- `name` — stable identifier: the key in `participant.json` and the `<name>` of the
  `${field.<name>}` filename variable. Unique within a protocol (a repeated name keeps the first
  occurrence and logs a warning).
- `labelKey` / `helpKey` — localization keys; `helpKey` is always present, its string may be
  empty (then no help line is shown).
- `placeholder` — hint text inside an empty text field.
- `regex` — validation pattern for free-text fields; empty means no pattern check.
- `required` — the form cannot continue while the field is blank.

**Identifier catalogue.** Some names have app-side behaviour; the server sends no options:

| `name` | App behaviour | Stored value |
|---|---|---|
| `current_date` | auto-filled with the examination date, read-only | `yyyy-MM-dd` |
| `sex` | dropdown: `male`, `female` | the option string |
| `education` | dropdown: `less than upper secondary`, `upper secondary and vocational`, `tertiary education` | the option string |
| `patient_code` | free text; also names the session folder (`yyyy-MM-dd_<code>_<sessionId>`) and ZIP (`<code>_<sessionId>.zip`) | as entered |
| anything else (incl. `surname`, `year_of_birth`) | free text validated by `regex` | as entered |

Option labels are the built-in keys `patientField.<name>.<option, spaces as _>` (for example
`patientField.education.tertiary_education`), which a config's `strings` may override.

## 6. Strings / localization

One map per language: `strings.<lang>.<key> → value`.

- Inline markup: `<bold>text</bold>` and `<italic>text</italic>` (nesting allowed). Legacy
  `_b` / `/b` tags are **not valid**; the app does not recognize them and they render as
  literal text.
- Markup is **inline only** — it styles a run of text, it does not start a new paragraph.
  `<bold>Start now.</bold>Press START…` renders as one continuous line. Where the original app
  showed a paragraph break (its `_b`/`/b` splitter inserted one automatically), the string must
  contain an explicit `\n\n`. Task instruction cards render each `instructionKeys` entry as its
  own paragraph, so splitting a two-paragraph instruction into two keys works equally well.
- Placeholders use named syntax: `{vowel}`, `{length}`, `{version}` (replaces the old
  `XX`/`xx` conventions). A placeholder the app does not substitute is left in the string
  verbatim — a leftover `XX` on screen means the config still uses the old convention.
- Newlines inside a string value use the standard JSON escape `\n` (a single backslash). A
  doubled backslash (`\\n`) is **not** a newline — it decodes to a literal backslash followed
  by the letter `n` and will render incorrectly.
- Missing key resolution: selected language → `defaultLanguage` → the key itself (logged).
